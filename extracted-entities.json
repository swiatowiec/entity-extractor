daily plight of ordinary people 19 private banks operate only one of which is run in accordance with Islamic banking principles Hopes are high for the future of finance so foreign banks have been buying into the sector National Bank of Kuwait has bought a majority stake in Credit Bank of Iraq the Jordanian investment bank Export Finance Bank has bought 49 of National Bank of Iraq Foreign firms also hope to cash in on the reconstruction effort Bechtel s efforts to rebuild schools and restore power have attracted controversy as well as boosting its bottom line while Halliburton has enjoyed a wealth of military contracts But the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many Iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work observes Ms Alexander It is seen as a selling off of Iraq s assets and bringing in multinationals at the expense of Iraqi businesses and Iraqi workers she says Consequently the transitional government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over its proposal to allow 100 foreign ownership of Iraqi assets she explains In the West it is easy to forget that the otherwise brutal Baathist regime used to look after the majority of Iraq s citizens rather well in terms of job creation social security and healthcare Opinion polls suggest that people still want the state to take a leading role in providing these things Ms Alexander says Yet in some areas of the economy investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed insists Mr Hadi an Iraqi who left the country three decades ago I think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast Mr Hadi says Iraq s vast natural resources can support any magnitude of economic growth Many foreign companies say they are keen to get in on the act yet few are actually entering the country in any meaningful way But there are exceptions Mr Hadi s Blackwatch is just one of many small operators

should go some way to allay fears of the Saab factory s closure The factory in Trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about GM s planned severe cutbacks in its troubled European operations But the group s new commitment to the Swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group s Opel workers in Ruesselsheim Germany They may now have to face a larger proportion of GM s cuts Neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden since it reflects Saab s failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market For years Saab has consistently said it is competing head on with BMW Mercedes and Jaguar The segment s leaders do not agree GM s plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers In the US it has long been established as an upmarket brand even the presidential limousine carries the badge Yet it could prove tough for Cadillac to steal market share from the majors in Europe Other luxury car makers most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe There German marques Mercedes Benz and BMW have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market Bringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately needed scale to the Saab factory which currently produces fewer than 130 000 cars per year That is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations and Saab is losing money fast albeit with losses halved in 2004 to 200m 104m 151m euros from 500m the previous year Beyond the 12 000 job cuts announced last year at its European operations GM is reducing expenditure by building Saabs Opels badged as Vauxhalls in the UK and now Cadillacs on the same framework and by allowing the different brands to share parts Another way to further reduce Saab s losses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the US a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar which is making Saabs more expensive to US consumers But not

treating these issues as one off events Despite its string of bad luck he pointed out Aurora is just one vessel in a large Carnival fleet the UK s P O Princess group having been merged into the much larger US firm in 2003 And generally speaking Carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule Carnival has an incredibly strong track record Mr Champion Similarly analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited The hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the Aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise That should mitigate some of the PR risk both for Carnival and its main competitor Royal Caribbean While not common cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry wrote analysts from Citigroup Smith Barney in a note to clients on Friday Moreover such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises After all the Aurora incident may be big news in the UK but for Carnival customers elsewhere it s unlikely to make too much of a splash Assuming that Citigroup is right and demand stays solid the structure of the industry also works in Carnival s favour In the wake of P O Princess s takeover by Carnival the business is now to a great extent a duopoly Given the expense of building outfitting and running a cruise ship slowing supply growth is a certainty said David Anders at Merrill Lynch on Thursday In other words if you do want a cruise your options are limited And

welcome message callers on average hang up after just 65 seconds of listening to canned music The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20 every year Customers are getting used to the idea of an always available society says Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data which commissioned the survey However call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls she says from just over 5 in 2003 to a record 13 3 during last year When automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages the number of abandoned calls is even higher a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait One possible reason for the lack in patience Ms Diemont says is the fact that more customers are calling on the move using their mobile phones The surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres growing range of tasks Once a call centre may have looked after mortgages now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards insurance and current accounts Ms Diemont says Problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand in hand with more training the survey found In what Dimension Data calls an alarming development the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days leaving agents not equipped to deal with customers This Ms Diemont warns is scary and not good for the bottom line either Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers As a result call centres have a high churn rate with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff Resolution rates the number of calls where a customer s query is resolved to mutual satisfaction are running at just 50 When the query is passed on to a second or third person a specialist or manager rates rise to about 70 but that is still well below the industry target of an 85 resolution rate Suggestions that outsourcing relocating call centres to low cost countries like India or South Africa is to blame are wrong Ms Diemont says There are no big differences in wait time and call resolution between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world You can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place she says However companies that decide to offshore their operations are driven not just by cost considerations Only 42 of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations Half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money But not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution Nearly two thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres They give three key reasons for not making the move call centre operations are part of their business core function they are worried about the risk of going abroad they fear that they will damage their brand if they
